numberScroll
============

###Changing HTML5 range input into scrollable digits

Dependencies:
-------------

 - [jQuery Mousewheel](https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel)

Usage
-----

    $("input[type=range]").numberScroll();

To do:
------

 - Make defaults (at the moment it MUST have a min, max and step attribute on everything)
 - Possibly add a click and drag to the numbers as well?
 - Maybe an option to show the range rather than putting display:block !important on it : S
 - Touch friendliness
